# Eat-Da-Burger!
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  This burger logger uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM.

## The Challenge:  
* Create a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, display the burger on the left side of the page -- in a list of burgers waiting to be devoured.

* Provide each burger in the waiting area with a 'devour it' button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page, to the list of devoured burgers.

* Store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.


## Built With

*  Node to route data
*  MySQL to query data
*  Handlebars to generate the HTML.
